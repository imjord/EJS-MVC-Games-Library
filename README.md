# EJS-MVC-Games-Library
Game Library nodejs/ejs/mongodb


W.I.P

Currently you can see trending games and get games by categories.

In the future i would like to add my own mongodb database were u can add the games to your own library.

Live heroku link... (heroku links are slow please be patient. also the token refreshs every 2 months so if their is an error getting the games its because i havent updated the token. please notify me if that is the case).
